# Hangman
## Description 
A React app that allows users to play Hangman. The game picks a random word, which the user must then attempt to guess letter-by-letter. Too many incorrect guesses result in loss of the game. Iconically, the process of losing is depicted by your character being hanged.

## Importance 
This repository is important as the Hangman game using React will need to consolidate and demonstrate all the concepts I have learned about React, JSX and JavaScript so far.
It also provides insights to my understanding and comprehension of HTML and CSS fundamentals.
